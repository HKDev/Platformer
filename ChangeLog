    Created 3 Layers for depth stacking on the FlxSprites. Add your sprites to the layer you want it to be on rather it be front/middle/back layer. Layers are named layer1,layer2,layer3. Also added a nullClass which is a 1x1 transparent pixel null.png to the Assets class. What this does and may not be needed but did not find a work around.. this allows you to use the FlxSprite without needing a graphic and without seeing default Flixel graphic when you don't have a class. The nullClass is still a graphic and will be added to the display but it is as minimal as possible and works for the job. If you have a better suggestion please notify me.

    Added player clone trail with alpha fade when running. If you reach a certain elapsed time tracked by FlxG.elapsed... A property speedStage will be set to either 1,2 or 3 each > setting the trail lengthens.. so the faster you go the more the trail grows... Tried not to make it to noticable and lengthy; Still working on this and going to place the clones behind the player so it will run more smoothly.

    Added a isSolid(Tile:uint):Boolean to check for tile index solidity... I did not see a way to get the solidity of a tile so I made one. If there was already a way let me know. Also the breakable tile now finds a non-solid tile to replace broken tile so that it matches the rest of the map. It should always find a non-solid neighboring tile due to the fact the bullet traveled and broke the tile in the first place...

    DocumentClass is now the Document Class again. If you open DocumentClass.as you can enable/disable the preloader. Feature requested by Hiren due to hardware specs of his workstation. The preloader works alot differently now... It's object is created in DocumentClass; It then loads the Assets class; After all assets are loaded the Preloader dispatches a custom CoreEvent.as Event which the DocumentClass is listening for and when it gets it the DocumentClass creates a newGame() which creates a new Game() object. The function will be for resetting specific properties that the Game object would require rest if a newGame was created while a old game exist.

    Lessened amount of enemies from a test I forgot to revert changes for when inspecting memory. If you want check out the previous commit first and see if it lags your machine. Previous commit has 30 enemies total. This commit has 17 which is still more than the original amount of 10 total. So keep in mind even this commit has more enemies than original version you might be used to

    Moved all Embedded assets to the DocumentClass. This is currently the class that the Preloader looks for assets in. After doing so I noticed a very nice result in the debugger memory graph. We have normal rise and fall with garbage collection and also at certain points within the fall we get very close to where the memory was at when we first ran the game. This is what we are looking for and is great news. Also I wrote a timer in State.as to cleanUp() it then calls timers that run periodically throughout the game cleaning up FlxGroups if they are to full of dead objects.... Currently they are just cleaning up enemy and playerBullets. I have set the max bullets in queue for the player to 5 and enemy set to 10. This seems to work fine. It will recycle through the 5 or 10 mentioned but we will not have FlxGroups filled to the brim with objects waiting to be recycled.

However right side of map not tested and there was a issue with the map width and player location so there might be one with the Bullet also. This is something we need to look at."

    Added Monster Debugger support. In order for it to work you must go to the .FLA "Actionscript Settings". Click "Library Path" Button and double click the location of MonsterDebugger.swc to change the location of the swc file for your machine. Mine is "/Game/Game/bin/MonsterDebugger.swc" I have my Game folder in the root directory on my computer. You must adjust this to point to it on your machine. As you see it's in the bin folder where the main .FLA is located in "Game". You might have to adjust the path to fit your machine/user/download location. Also disabled pixel that was tracking the players x,y.

    Added Preloader. I used FlxPreloader which is not compatible with Flash CS due to Meta tags. I had to make a small edit on FlxPreloader. And line out the object linkage so that everything flowed smoothly with the addition. The Preloader is bare/basic so it still needs the assets then override update(percent:Number):void to add the resizing of the progress bar or other features.

    Worked on a seperate sprite for the rolling feature. Still needs improvement but I do think its better than the previous look of the sprite rotating. Played with the speeds I think where its at or maybe slightly slower is the best result visually

commit 03da81f9e0f8e513e7d00c76f07d3ca84b4556ef

    If you are rolling and you set a grenade 'C'.. If the player is centered over the grenade it will add to velocity.y -100. If the player is on the sides of the grenade however it will launch him with a little more thrust to the left and right. The rolling feature adds the ability to fit in 1 tile crevises/spaces. If you are in rolling position and you plant a grenade as long as its centered it will bounce you upward in the air allowing you to jump while rolling into crevises/small spaces. I will be making a BUG addition, but it will be more an enhancement. It will recommend maybe allowing the grenade to attach to walls depending on the primary background layer tile. Refer to that report for more details on where I'm going with it.

    Enemy Bullets collide with solid map tiles; Bullets s/b destroyed when outside of game world; Slowed enemy rate of fire down; Different method of adding Enemy's to the map. This is still not a solid method just something to open the addition possibility up a little bit. Fixed a but where the healthbar was being drawn and updated from player.health. Problem was it was being updated when player health was non existant. Fixed this issue.
